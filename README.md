## Dataset

<div align="justify">
  
### The dataset is from Alibaba Cloud which contains 1 million users who have behaviors including click, purchase, adding item to shopping cart and item favoring during November 25 to December 03, 2017. Since the dataset is too large, I only randomly select 1 million rows from the dataset.     https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/649

## Tools that I used

<div align="justify">
  
### Firsrt I use Python to randomly select 1 million rows from 100 millions records, Then I use Kettle to rapidly import data from csv to the database and I use Navicat 17 for MySQL to write query and do the data analysis, I also use Tableau to do some visualization on some table I created, but I didn't include the result in the project beacuse the data I randomly selected does not accurately reflect the reality, but the logic behind the query is correct.
